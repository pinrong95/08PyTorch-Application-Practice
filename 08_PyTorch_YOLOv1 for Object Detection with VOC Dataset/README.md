# YOLOv1 for Object Detection with VOC Dataset

## Introduction
This project uses YOLOv1 for object detection and is trained on Google Colab.

## Environment Setup
1. **Open Google Colab**
2. **Upload the Notebook (`YOLOv1_voc.ipynb`)**
3. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   !pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements file is available
   ```

## Dataset Preparation (VOC Dataset Used)
- **The VOC dataset is exclusively used for training**, ensure it is downloaded and extracted.
- If the notebook contains download commands, execute the corresponding cells.

## Model Source
- Pretrained weights are from [YOLO official model](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
- It may use ImageNet pre-trained feature extraction layers as initial weights.

## Training Procedure
1. **Load the dataset**
2. **Set hyperparameters** (such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.)
3. **Start training**
   ```python
   model.train()
   ```
4. **Save training results and model weights**

## Parameter Description
- `learning_rate`: Controls how quickly the model updates weights.
- `batch_size`: Number of samples processed per training step.
- `epochs`: Number of training iterations.

## Results Analysis
- Loss variation during training
- Prediction results on test images

## How to Use for Inference
1. Load the trained model weights
2. Upload a test image
3. Run inference to see detection results

```python
model.predict(image)
```

## Additional Information
If you encounter any issues, check the notebook for error messages or verify that the environment setup is correct.
